As a self-taught software developer, I've been inspired to dive into the world of blockchain by building a project from scratch across multiple programming languages. This repository is my personal exploration of blockchain fundamentals, designed as a hands-on way to deepen my understanding of concepts like cryptographic hashing, transaction management, proof of work, and decentralized ledgers.
Through this project, I aim to learn, grow, and eventually contribute to the open-source community by sharing insights and code examples that might help others starting their blockchain journey.
